The official <a href="https://angular.io/tutorial">"Tour of Heroes" Angular tutorial app</a> with extra features added (based on the <a href="https://www.skillsoft.com/channel/angular-f3619a61-1944-11e7-b488-c198130a9b04?technologyandversion=84199&expertiselevel=84192">Percipio courses</a> and my own invention :))

Extra Features include:
- adding an external (plain) JavaScript file to the app (app.module.ts - subtitle with current time & date);
- authorization guards preventing users from accessing certain paths (AdminComponent and the position fields);
- an additional field: hero position;
- lazy loading content (FaqComponent);
